When processing files in the data/ directory of a package 

== dest ==

== check ==

If the file has been modified locally after package revision 1 is installed, on upgrade to package revision 2 the file will be overwritten with the contents of package 2 - if any.

You can control this behaviour on a per-file basis:

=== ignore ===

Silently ignore the local change and overwrite its contents from the new package revision. 

=== warn (Default) ===

Ignore the local change and overwrite its contents from the new package revision. This logs a warning during upgrade. 

=== fail ===

The package revision upgrade does not take place, instead the whole package will be suspended pending administrator input (they can then use --force to override local changes on the command line).

=== skip ===

The package is still upgraded but this file is skipped from the upgrade process altogether. This is not recommended but in certain cases this might be useful.

== action ==

=== copy ===

Copy the file to the location specified by "dest"

=== link ===

Link the file to the location specified by "dest"

=== linkr ===

Link the file, overwriting (recursively if its a directory) if it exists, to the location specified by "dest".

=== linko ===

Link the file, overwriting if it exists, to the location specified by "dest".

== chmod ==

Set the octal permissions.

== owner ==

Set the owner.

== group ==

Set the group.

== uid ==

== gid ==
